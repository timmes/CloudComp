# Learning Gamification Platform - Project Notes

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a local web application that gamifies organizational learning by tracking activities and awarding points for completion, performance, and achievements.

**Core Principle**: Simplicity first - fast iteration, minimal complexity, local-first approach.

**Current Version**: 1.0 with Teams Feature

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind), Vanilla JavaScript
- **Storage**: localStorage (browser storage) with JSON export/import
- **Hosting**: Local files (no server required)
- **Deployment**: Single HTML file (cloud_comp_app.html)
- **External Dependencies**: 
  - Tailwind CSS (CDN)
  - XLSX library for Excel processing (CDN)

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Primary**: localStorage for immediate persistence
- **Export/Import**: JSON files for backup and data transfer
- **Backup**: Manual exports create timestamped JSON files
- **Considerations**: 
  - Browser-based storage for zero-setup deployment
  - Admin-only tool (no multi-user authentication)
  - Bulk import from existing systems (course activity, Teams attendance)

### Performance
- Handles 10,000+ activities efficiently
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Debounced search and filtering
- Optimized DOM manipulation

### Data Limits
- localStorage: ~5-10MB per origin
- Recommended: Export backup at 5,000+ activities
- JSON export creates complete data snapshot

### Security & Privacy
- All data stays local (privacy by design)
- No external API calls
- No tracking or analytics
- User controls all data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Data not saving**: Check browser localStorage settings
2. **Import failing**: Verify file format and required columns
3. **Points not calculating**: Review configuration settings
4. **Teams not updating**: Ensure members are valid users

### Data Recovery
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Use JSON export/import for backup
3. localStorage data persists across sessions
4. Clear cache does NOT affect localStorage

## Development Notes

### Code Structure
- **Single file**: All code in cloud_comp_app.html
- **Global state**: appData object manages all data
- **Auto-save**: Triggered after any data change
- **Modular functions**: Organized by feature area

### Key Functions
- `loadData()`: Initialize from localStorage
- `saveData()`: Persist to localStorage
- `processAllFiles()`: Multi-file import handler
- `refreshDashboard()`: Update all dashboard elements
- `updateAllTeamPoints()`: Recalculate team scores
- `calculatePoints()`: Apply point configuration

### Adding New Features
1. Update data model if needed
2. Add UI elements to appropriate section
3. Implement functions following existing patterns
4. Include in save/load operations
5. Update export/import handling
